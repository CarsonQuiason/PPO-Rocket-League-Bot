# Carball AI RLbot
Forked from Impossibum's RLGymExampleBot.  
Used to convert a Reinforcement Learning training bot in [RlGym](https://rlgym.github.io/) to the [RLbot](https://rlbot.org/) framework for easier testing against official and user created bots. 
## Changing the bot

- Bot behavior is controlled by `bot.py`
- Bot appearance is controlled by `appearance.cfg`

See https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotPythonExample/wiki for documentation and tutorials.
